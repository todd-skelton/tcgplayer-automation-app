# Supply Analysis Listing Optimization

## Overview

This optimization improves the performance of the supply analysis feature by implementing early termination when fetching listings that exceed the maximum historical sales price for a given SKU.

## Problem

Previously, when supply analysis was enabled with the `maxListingsPerSku` option, the system would fetch all listings in ascending price order without any upper bound. This could result in fetching many high-priced listings that would never be relevant for time-to-sell calculations.

## Solution

### Client-Side Price Filtering with Early Termination

Since we cannot modify the external TCGplayer API, the optimization is implemented client-side in the `getAllListings` function:

1. **Calculates the maximum sales price** from historical sales data for the SKU
2. **Filters listings client-side** to exclude prices above the maximum
3. **Terminates API calls early** when encountering listings above the price threshold
4. **Reduces unnecessary API pagination** for irrelevant high-priced listings

### Implementation Details

- **Client-side filtering**: Applied after each API response in `getAllListings`
- **Early termination**: Stops fetching additional pages when price threshold is exceeded
- **Automatic**: No configuration required - the optimization is applied automatically
- **Logging**: Console messages show when early termination occurs
- **Fallback**: If no sales data is available, no price filtering is applied

### Performance Benefits

- **Reduced API calls**: Stops pagination early when hitting irrelevant price ranges
- **Faster processing**: Less data to fetch and process
- **Lower network usage**: Fewer API requests for high-priced listings
- **Improved efficiency**: Focus on relevant price points for time-to-sell calculations

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified

1. **`get-listings.ts`**: Added optional `maxPrice` parameter to `getAllListings` function with early termination logic
2. **`supplyAnalysisService.ts`**: Updated to use `getAllListings` with price optimization and simplified the fetching logic
3. **`getSuggestedPriceFromLatestSales.ts`**: Calculates max sales price and passes it to supply analysis

### Example

```typescript
// Historical sales data: $1.50, $2.00, $2.25, $3.00
// Max sales price: $3.00
// getAllListings called with maxPrice: 3.00
// Early termination when API returns listings > $3.00
// This prevents fetching $5.00, $10.00, etc. listings that would never be relevant
```

## Monitoring

When the optimization is active, you'll see console messages like:

```
Supply analysis optimization: Fetching listings for SKU 12345 with price limit ≤ $3.00
getAllListings: Early termination at price threshold $3.00 after 85 listings
```

## Backward Compatibility

This optimization is fully backward compatible:

- ✅ Existing configurations work unchanged
- ✅ No breaking changes to APIs
- ✅ Graceful degradation if sales data is unavailable
- ✅ Optional optimization - activated automatically when beneficial

## Impact

This optimization is particularly beneficial for:

- **High-volume processing**: Reduces cumulative API overhead
- **Expensive cards**: Cards with wide price ranges see the most benefit
- **Rate-limited environments**: Less API usage helps avoid limits
- **Large inventories**: Compound savings across many SKUs
