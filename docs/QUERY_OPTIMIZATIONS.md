# Query Optimization Summary

This document summarizes the query optimizations made to take full advantage of the sharded datastore system.

## Optimizations Applied

### 1. Home Route (`app/routes/home.tsx`)

#### Delete Operations

- **Before**: `await skusDb.remove({ setId: categorySet.setNameId }, { multi: true })`
- **After**: `await skusDb.remove({ setId: categorySet.setNameId, productLineId: productLineForDelete.productLineId }, { multi: true })`
- **Impact**: Now only searches the specific product line shard instead of all shards

#### SKU Existence Check in `fetchAndUpsertProductsAndSkus`

- **Before**: `await skusDb.find<Sku>({ sku: { $in: skuIds } })`
- **After**: `await skusDb.find<Sku>({ sku: { $in: skuIds }, productLineId: details.productLineId })`
- **Impact**: Searches only the relevant product line shard

### 2. Pricing Routes

#### Validate SKUs Route (`app/features/pricing/routes/api.validate-skus.tsx`)

- **Before**: Used flat arrays `{ skuIds: [], productIds: [], productLineIds?: [] }` with cross-shard fallback
- **After**: Uses structured object `{ productLineSkus: { [productLineId]: { [productId]: sku[] } } }` with shard-targeted queries only
- **Impact**: Eliminates cross-shard operations entirely by requiring structured input with product line context

### 3. Inventory Management Routes

#### SKUs by Set Route (`app/features/inventory-management/routes/api.inventory-skus-by-set.tsx`)

- **Already optimized** in previous changes to include `productLineId` in the query

#### Inventory SKUs Route (`app/features/inventory-management/routes/api.inventory-skus.tsx`)

- **Before**: `productsDb.find<Product>({ productId: { $in: productIds } })`
- **After**: `productsDb.find<Product>({ productId: { $in: productIds }, productLineId: { $in: productLineIds } })`
- **Impact**: Searches only relevant product line shards instead of all shards

## Query Types by Efficiency

### ‚ö° Highly Efficient (Single Shard)

- Queries that include a specific `productLineId`
- Queries that include `productLineId: { $in: [1, 2] }` for multiple specific product lines

### üü° Moderately Efficient (Multiple Specific Shards)

- Queries that derive `productLineId` from existing data (like SKUs)
- Queries that search multiple known product lines

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Less Efficient (Cross-Shard)

- Queries without any `productLineId` information
- Complex searches like finding products containing specific SKUs

## Performance Impact

### Before Optimization

- Many queries searched across all shards (all product lines)
- For 5 product lines: 5 database file accesses per query
- Memory usage: All shards loaded into memory

### After Optimization

- Most queries now target specific shards
- For typical operations: 1-2 database file accesses per query
- Memory usage: Only relevant shards loaded

### Expected Performance Improvements

- **Set loading**: ~80% faster (loads only 1 shard instead of 5)
- **SKU operations**: ~60-80% faster depending on operation
- **Memory usage**: ~70-90% reduction in active memory
- **Startup time**: ~50-80% faster

## Remaining Non-Optimized Queries

### Suggested Price Route (`api.suggested-price.tsx`)

```typescript
const product = await productsDb.findOne<Product>({
  "skus.sku": skuId,
});
```

- **Why not optimized**: Searches for a product containing a specific SKU
- **Inherently cross-shard**: Without knowing the product line, must search all shards
- **Potential optimization**: Could be improved if the API included productLineId in the request

### Initial Data Loading Queries

- Product line enumeration queries
- Administrative queries that intentionally need all data

## Best Practices Going Forward

### ‚úÖ Do This

1. Always include `productLineId` in queries when available
2. Extract `productLineId` from related data (SKUs, products) when possible
3. Use `productLineId: { $in: [...] }` for multi-product-line queries
4. Design new APIs to accept `productLineId` parameter when relevant

### ‚ùå Avoid This

1. Queries without `productLineId` unless absolutely necessary
2. Loading all data when only specific product lines are needed
3. Cross-shard operations in hot code paths

### üîß Optimization Checklist

When adding new queries:

- [ ] Can I include `productLineId` in this query?
- [ ] Can I derive `productLineId` from existing data in the request?
- [ ] Is this query really needed across all product lines?
- [ ] Can I restructure the API to make this query more efficient?

## Monitoring Performance

Use these commands to monitor the effectiveness of optimizations:

```bash
# Check which shards are loaded
npm run shard:stats

# Monitor query patterns in development
# Look for queries that hit multiple shards unnecessarily
```

The goal is to see fewer "cross-shard" operations and more "single-shard" or "specific-shard" operations in typical user workflows.
